# Data transformation library
- Develop a Data Transformation Library that enables seamless data exchange among consumers who require different data formats. 
- Consumers may generate or interpret data in various formats (e.g., XML, JSON, CSV), and this library should convert data from one format to another.
- Given the source and target formats, the library will handle the transformation while preserving data integrity and ensuring the output is structured to meet the target consumerâ€™s requirements.

## Functional Requirements

- The library must support transformations between XML, JSON, and CSV formats.
- It should accept data in a source format and convert it to a target format.
- The transformation process should maintain data integrity, preserving data types, encoding, and nested structures across formats.
