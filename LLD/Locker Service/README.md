### Problem statement:
Design a Locker management system for an ecommerce store. While performing a purchase, the users can opt for their packages to get delivered at a Locker system close to their place. The delivery person will place the package in a locker. An otp will be generated and sent to the user once the package is added to the locker.

As per the userâ€™s convenience, they can visit the locker, enter the otp and get their parcel. Further, if the users want to return the goods, they can visit the locker and place the item. Delivery guy will get an otp which can be used to unlock the locker.

#### Following are the expectations from the system:
1.	Person asks the system to allocate a locker for a given package. Assume random allocation for now. The system should be extensible and accommodate allocation of locker based on the size of the input package
2.	The system must generate a code/otp and send it to the user along with the locker details
3.	The user can enter the otp & locker details to unlock the locker
4.	Once the package is taken out, the locker can be allocated for any other order
5.	Users can use the locker for returning an item. OTP/code will be sent to the delivery person in this case
6.	Operations/Admin can view & vacate all lockers which are in use for more than 3 days
