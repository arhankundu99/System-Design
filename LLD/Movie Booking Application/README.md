# Problem statement
- Design an movie booking system.
- When a user chooses seat(s), then that seat(s) should be temporarily unavailable to other users.
- User completes the payment and gets the assigned seat.
- No two users should get same ticket.

- The code is not complete fully but highlights the important parts.
